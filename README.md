He took down xtc.ninja/ninja/connecttest.php so I'm releasing this new version to bypass that fact =D.<br />
This also contains the image he injects into the game, along with a .i64 from my 5 seconds of reversing.

Does not work on 1909 or (afaik) 1903 because omen is a wet donny bruv.<br />
Edit: Fixed the fact that it will refuse to inject. It is also now completely independent of the server and will work until the next game update.
